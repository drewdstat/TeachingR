```

## Introduction

This document is a guide to understanding some basic features of R. There are other, more official guides you can also refer to, such as the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN) [official R manual](https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-intro.pdf). Another great resource similar to this is the guide by Sarah Bonnin called [Introduction to R 2021](https://biocorecrg.github.io/CRG_RIntroduction/index.html).

R is a programming language that deals with assigning variables, creating functions to manipulate those variables, organizing and manipulating data, creating visualizations and even web applications, and many more tools. We'll go through these systematically to give you a sense of how to use R.

This html document you're reading was created entirely within R using a package (i.e., a saved set of functions, sometimes with example data as well) called 'rmarkdown'. These Markdown documents can be in many forms, such as presentation slides or documents like this one, and they can combine several different types of code; such as R, CSS, YAML, etc.; to make a fancy web page-like format for presenting data. We'll get into that later, though.

## R Interface

First, let's explore the RStudio interface as shown [below](https://biocorecrg.github.io/CRG_RIntroduction/rstudio-interface.html). There are generally four windows open that you can rearrange however you like. When you open base R, the interface is much simpler and only includes one or two windows. 

```{r echo=F, results='asis'}
cat(paste0("<center><img src='https://biocorecrg.github.io/CRG_RIntroduction/images/rstudio_interface.png'></center>"))
```
  
We'll start with the first window that pops up in base R, the console (bottom left in the image above). The console prints out output and can also accept code one line at a time that you can run by pressing 'Enter' on your keyboard. This is a place to view and run temporary code and output, as none of the code or output printed to the console is saved (except some of the most recent history of the lines of code you run here is saved in an .Rhistory file). You can cycle through previous lines of code you ran by pressing the up and down directional keys on your keyboard.

Another important window is the window containing your scripts (top left in the image above). Different from the console, this window contains code that you want to save, stored in scripts with many lines of code as .R files. No output is shown in this window (with the exception of Markdown files, but that'll come later). You can run lines of code here using Ctrl+Enter, which either runs only the line of code your cursor is on (always true in base R), runs all associated lines of code if your cursor is on a multi-line call (e.g., a function that takes up many lines), or runs all pieces of code you've highlighted, which can be just a part of a line or many lines. 

In RStudio, there's also a window that shows your environment, which is where all variables you make are stored. In base R you don't have this window, but you can print out all variables in your current environment by running the code `ls()`. The objects in this environment can be saved one at a time in .Rda or .RData files, and the entire environment can also be saved as a .RData file. 

Finally, there is a general purpose window that shows files, plots, help manual pages, your currently downloaded/loaded packages, and a viewer for interactive plots/tables. When starting, we'll mostly use this for the help tab. You can look up any help manual page for any function by either searching for it in the search bar in this tab or running the code `?` before the name of a function (e.g., `?mean`).

## Assigning Variables

R and other similar languages like Python are [object-oriented programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming) languages. This means that this language is designed around data stored as objects rather than designed around functions and logic. Let's start by understanding how to assign basic variables. You can assign variables using an arrow ('<-' or '->') or '='. The former two are more specific and are the norm, especially the left arrow. The reason you want to use this rather than the equals sign is that you may have two variable names you've set, and if you set `variable1 = variable2`, it's unclear which one should be replaced with the other, at least for others reading your code, though in reality in this case `variable1` would take on the value of `variable2`. Convention is to put the variable name on the left and what is being assigned to it on the right.

Below I set several numbers to be various variable names. Note that variable names can be anything as long as they don't start with a number, contain spaces, or have certain characters ('_' is fine, but most other characters are not). For example, assigning a variable to `2var` won't work since it starts with a number, but `var2` does work. If you must deal with variables with spaces or other unacceptable characters in the variable name, you can do that by wrapping the name of the variable in ``. 

Note that I add notes to my code for reference using '#', which silences all code after it in a given line. You can highlight lines of code you want to silence and press Ctrl+Shift+C in RStudio to "comment out" those lines or to reverse that. Note also that spaces don't really matter for most types of R codes.

```{r}
a<-5
8 -> pizza #right arrows are harder to read and are discouraged
var2    = 35.67

pizza_pie <- "this is a string"

#Doesn't work:
# 35.67 = var2 
# 2var <- 35.67

#You can coerce variable names with otherwise unacceptable characters using ``
`2 var` <- 8
`3$&@#` <- "seriously don't assign a variable like this even though you can"

```

## Operators

Operators perform mathematical manipulations of your objects. A good list can be found [at this link](https://intellipaat.com/blog/tutorial/r-programming/operators/?US). 

First, let's go over basic mathematical operators using the following code:

```{r}
18-3.45
2*3
a/pizza

2**3 #exponentiation
3%%2 #remainder after division

#You can't apply math operators to strings (also called "characters")
#Doesn't work: 
# pizza_pie/4 #Note the error message that pops up when you run this
```

Other operators are logical in nature, leading to TRUE or FALSE output. These are demonstrated below:

```{r}
a >= pizza #greater than or equal to
14 == 15 #equal to
14!=15 #not equal to
7%in%6:8 #is the left object within the vector on the right of '%in%'
!10 %in% 1:3 #opposite of within (i.e., "not in") 
```

## Functions

Functions are central to programming in R. They are an object defined in the code that defines input called arguments, manipulates that input, and then returns output. Every R function in base R and available through official package repositories like CRAN has a manual page that can be seen as mentioned before using `?` or searching in the help tab.

All functions are of the format `function_name(arguments)`. Every time you use parentheses in R, it's because you're defining function inputs/arguments. If you want to know what the arguments are for a given function, you can run `args(function_name)` to print them out, or you can just read about them in the help page. 

One of the simplest functions is used to concatenate (i.e., join together) individual values into a vector using the function `c`. In the example below, I join the numbers assigned to variables earlier. A vector in linear algebra is simply a quantity that cannot be expressed with a scalar (i.e., one number) and is both ordered and of a single dimension. We can think of this as a single column in a matrix (e.g., a list of ages for participants in a study).

```{r}
vector1 <- c() #assigns an empty vector

vector2 <- c(a, pizza)
vector2

vector3 <- 6:10 # the single colon in R defines an adjacent integer sequence, here 6, 7, 8, 9, & 10

vector4 <- c(6:10,35,5:-2) # the colon can be used in a forward or backward direction
vector4
```

Another more programmatic way to assign variables is using a function called `assign`.

```{r}
assign("vector3",6:10)
vector3
```

If you enter the arguments in the order that they are defined in the function, you don't need to name them specifically using `argument1 = ...`, but if you go out of order for any reason, you do need to name the argument. For example, the arguments for the function to make a sequence of numbers `seq` are as follows: `from = 1, to = 1, by = ((to - from)/(length.out - 1)), length.out = NULL, along.with = NULL, ...`. If you input the order seq(from, to, by) (e.g., `seq(0,2,0.2)`), you don't need to specify `from = x`, etc., but you do need to specify `length.out = x` (spaces are optional) if you skip the `by=` argument that is superceded when length.out is anything other than NULL.

```{r}
vector5 <- seq(to=6.5,from=1.5,by=0.5)
vector5 <- seq(1.5,6.5,0.5) #this is the same as above
vector5 <- seq(1.5,6.5,length.out=10) #have to specify the length.out since it's out of order
vector5 #Here I replace vector5 with a sequence with 10 evenly spaced values between 1.5 and 6.5

# rep is another function that repeats values
rep(c(2,4),2)
rep(c(2,4),each=2)
```

## Data Classes

### Vectors {.tabset}

#### Numeric

Data exists in many types of data classes in R, which affect the behavior of each object. The function `class(object)` will tell you the data class of a given object. First we will go over various vector objects. The first is "numeric" for continuous values, which in other languages is sometimes called a "float" since the numeric value is represented using a [floating number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floating-point_arithmetic). Like other computer languages, R uses the [float64 format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-precision_floating-point_format) (for 64 bits of data) that is accurate up to the 10^-16^ place.

```{r}
vec1<-c()
#this creates an empty vector

#numeric - continuous values
set.seed(15) #set.seed sets a seed for a random process to make it reproducible
#put any integer as the seed; here I randomly chose 15

vec1<-rnorm(20,0.5,2) #draws 20 random Normally distributed values with mean=0.5 and SD=2
class(vec1)
vec1
length(vec1)

# side note: Rounding of numeric vectors:
round(vec1,2) #rounds to hundredths
signif(vec1,2) #keeps 2 significant figures

#to how many decimal places is the numeric class accurate?
formatC(1/3,16)
formatC(1/3,20) #noise after 16 decimal places
```

#### Integer

The next vector class is "integer" for integers and counts. We can create new objects with a given class by calling the function with that class name (e.g., `numeric(2)` gives a vector of zeros of length 2), and we can coerce existing objects to have a certain class using the 'as.x' functions (e.g., `as.numeric`, `as.integer`, etc.).

```{r}
#integer - integers/counts
vec2<-as.integer(vec1) #as.X coerces one class into another
class(vec2)
vec2
#here I coerce (i.e., force) the continuous "numeric" class into an "integer" class,
#  so every value is rounded to its nearest integer

#Data sampled from a Poisson or negative binomial distribution (both used to model counts) have the "integer" class
class(rpois(10,2))
```

#### Logical

Next is the "logical" class for TRUE/FALSE statements. In other languages, these vectors are sometimes called booleans. In R, true is represented with `TRUE` or `T` and false with `FALSE` or `F`. 

```{r}
#logical - TRUE/FALSE (also called a 'boolean')
boolean1 <- vec1<0
class(boolean1)
boolean1
which(boolean1) #returns the indices (i.e., positions) of the TRUE elements

which(vec1> -1 & vec1<1) #AND logical statement
which(vec1> -1 | vec1<1) #OR logical statement
```

#### Character

Strings and other non-numeric and non-logical (T/F) characters can be stored in a vector with a class called "character". This class has no ordering or numeric value assigned to any of the unique characters. Using `paste`

```{r}
#character - 'strings', i.e., non-numeric characters
vec2 <- as.character(vec1)
vec2 <- paste0(round(vec1,1),"%") #paste0 pastes characters together without a separator
class(vec2)
vec2
```

#### Factor

```{r}
#factor - ordered strings with levels, used for unordered and ordinal strings even though
#  there's a rarely used "ordinal" class too
vec2<-as.factor(c("pizza","pie","ice cream")) #default factor level is alphanumerically ordered
class(vec2)
vec2
levels(vec2)
summary(vec2) #summary is a broad function to summarize any R object
vec2<-factor(vec2,levels=c("pizza","pie","ice cream")) #reorder factor levels
summary(vec2)
levels(vec2)<-paste0("NewName",1:3) #rename factor levels without reordering them
summary(vec2) #see also: table(vec2)
as.numeric(vec2) #shows how the factor is numerically encoded
```

#### Date

```{r}
#Date - dates
date1<-as.Date(c("2002-01-03","1994-12-24")) #default format; time zone defaults to your computer's
date1<-as.Date(c("01/03/2022","12/24/1994"),format="%m/%d/%Y") #same as above
class(date1)
date1
diff(date1) #default is units="days"
#use the package 'lubridate' for more time-related functions
```

#### POSIXt

```{r}
#POSIXct and POSIXlt - date-times stored as a single scalar or a list, respectively
date1<-as.POSIXct(c("2001-01-01 15:00:00","2022-08-07 14:00:00")) #default format
class(date1)
date1
date1<-as.POSIXlt(date1)
class(date1)
date1$hour
```

### Matrices

Multiple vectors of equal length can be placed together as separate columns in a matrix. Matrices can have individual strings assigned to name rows and columns with `rownames(matrix1)` and `colnames(matrix1)`, respectively. Alternatively, `dimnames(matrix1)` will print out a list of the rownames and colnames, and we'll get into what a list is later. You'll often want to use the matrix class for performing mathematical operations, such as matrix multiplication. Certain functions also require datasets organized into columns and rows to be in matrix format.

```{r}
matrix1 <- matrix(1:6,2,3,byrow=T)
matrix1

colnames(matrix1) <- paste("C",1:3,sep="")
rownames(matrix1) <- paste0("R",1:2)
matrix1
colnames(matrix1)
dimnames(matrix1)
dim(matrix1)
```

### Arrays

If you want to have higher dimensional arrays than 1-D (vectors) or 2-D (matrices), you'll want to use the array class. You could technically use that for the 1- and 2-D cases, but that's rarely useful. The example below creates a 3-D array of dimensions 2, 4, 2.

```{r}
array(1:2,c(2,4,2))
```

### Lists

Lists are general purpose ways of storing varied classes of object all in the same place. You can have lists that include nested lists and include everything from scalars to plots to functions to interactive plots to data frames to entire models (e.g., all the output of a linear regression), which themselves are often lists of lists. Lists can have names for each of their elements, which are assigned and referred to using the function `names`. Lists are unique in that they use the '$' to call out each of their named elements.

```{r}
l1<-list(Scalar=10,Vector=seq(-10,10,length.out=4),Matrix=matrix(1:9,3,3))
class(l1)
class(l1$Vector)
l1
```

### Data Frames

Data frames are like matrices, except they are really stored as lists of columns. This means they have rownames and colnames like a matrix, but they are lists as well, so they also have names for each column stored in names. 

```{r}
df1 <- as.data.frame(matrix1)
df1
df2 <- data.frame(x=rnorm(10),y=letters[1:10])
df2
names(df2)
names(df2)<-c("Exposure","Outcome")
head(df2)
tail(df2)
summary(df2)

#let's store things related to the data frame in another list
l1 <- list()
l1[[1]]<-df2
l1[[2]]<-hist(df2$Exposure, breaks=20)
names(l1)<-c("DataFrame","Histogram")

#Can make lists like below too:
l1 <- list(DataFrame=df2,Histogram=hist(df2$Exposure))

l1$DataFrame

```

## Making Functions

R programmers tend to do most of their coding in the form of custom functions set up to perform all the tasks they want to do. Assigning a new function always take the format of `function_name <- function(arguments){body}`. Curly brackets '{}' evaluate multiple "expressions" (i.e., lines of code) at once and only return the output of the last line of code. They are used to denote the body of a function, for/while loop, if/else statement, etc., but they are not necessary if the body of any of those is just one line since that's just one expression. The arguments are your inputs, and then in the body you do something with those inputs and then specify an output. The output can be returned by specifying `return(your_output)` on the last line of the function, which will cause the function to end and return whatever object is in the parentheses. No code in the body of the function after `return` will run. Also, output can be returned just by having the last line of the body of the function be some call that leads to some output (e.g., having the last line be `x*y` or `plot(results)`).

You can set default values for arguments so that you don't always have to specify each argument. For example, if your function is `ex1 <- function(x,y=pi) x**y`, then if I don't specify y, it will default to pi. 

When functions run, they actually create a temporary internal environment that brings in objects you've already defined in your main environment and then evaluate the arguments and any internally defined objects. Once the function is finished, it runs the output, but all other variables defined in the arguments or within the body of the function disappear.

```{r}
#format for making functions:
# function_name <- function(arguments) body

standev <- function(x) sqrt(var(x))

#set seed of a random process to make it reproducible
set.seed(14)
ages <- rnorm(500,30,sd=3)
# hist(ages,breaks=50)
standev(ages)
sd(ages) #here's the base R function that performs standard deviations. Note how the output is the same as our standev function.
```

```{r}
nalen<- function(x) length(which(is.na(x)))
ex1 <-c(1,2,NA,-1,0,NA)
nalen(ex1)

is.na(ex1) 
which(is.na(ex1)) #gives index values of boolean
length(ex1)
length(which(!is.na(ex1)))
length(is.na(ex1))

nalen <- function(vec1, wantnacount=T){
  if(wantnacount){
    output<- length(which(is.na(ex1)))
  } else {
    output <- length(which(!is.na(ex1)))
  }
  return(output)
}
nalen(ex1,F)

df3<-mvtnorm::rmvnorm(500,rep(0,5)) 
#this creates a random multivariate Normal distribution of 5 variables with means of 0 and 0 covariance

df3<-as.data.frame(df3)
names(df3)<-paste0("x",1:5)

df3$yhat<- as.matrix(df3[,grep("x",names(df3))]) %*% c(-2,0.2,0,0,1)
df3$y <- df3$yhat + rnorm(nrow(df3))

fancy<-function(formula,Data){
  lm1<-lm(formula,Data)
  coef<-summary(lm1)$coef
  return(list(Coef=coef,Model=lm1))
}

form1<-formula(paste0("y~",paste(paste0("x",1:5),collapse="+")))
f1<-fancy(form1,df3)
names(f1)
par(mfrow=c(2,2))
plot(f1$Model)
par(mfrow=c(1,1))
# View(f1$Coef)
```

## If Else statements

If else statements define what happens conditionally. They are of the form if(logical_statement){body1} else {body2}. In this form, you can only evaluate one logical statement at a time (this includes linking several together with AND or OR logic). If you need to create conditional actions over a vector, use `ifelse()`.

```{r}
arg1<-"option_a"
if(arg1=="option_b"){
  print("arg1 is option_b")
} else if(grepl("a",arg1)){ #grepl is the logical form of grep, which searches for patterns (the latter returns indices)
  print(paste0("arg1 is option_",substr(arg1,nchar(arg1),nchar(arg1))))
} else {
  print("arg1 is not a known option")
}

set.seed(4)
testvec1<-rnorm(40)
summary(ifelse(testvec1<0,1,0)) #ifelse() is for a vector of logical expressions rather than one at a time
```

## For loops

For loops perform a repetitive function over a vector of values.

```{r}
mysds<-c()
for(i in 1:3){
  mysds<-c(mysds,standev(rnorm(1000,sd=i)))
}
mysds

df2$z<-df2$Exposure+rnorm(nrow(df2))
apply(as.matrix(df2[,-2]),2,function(x) mean(x,na.rm=T))

lapply(df2[,-2],mean)
mycolmeans<-sapply(df2[,-2],mean)
names(mycolmeans)
```

## Apply

R has several `apply`-related functions that perform a function over a vector representing one argument in that function (or multiple vectors representing multiple arguments as implemented in `mapply`).

```{r}
head(iris) #this is a classic R example dataset included in base R

sapply(iris, class) #outputs vector, matrix, list or whatever seems to fit the output best

lapply(iris, class) #outputs a list

Pearson<-function(x,y,Data){
  cort<-cor.test(Data[,x], Data[,y])
  return(list(Coef=cort$estimate, pval=cort$p.value))
}
#function comes first in mapply but second in sapply, apply, lapply, tapply, etc.
mapply(Pearson,x=names(iris)[1:2],y=names(iris)[3:4],MoreArgs=list(Data=iris))
```

## Combining Concepts - Looped Functions

Below we create a simple function to iterate linear models over vectors of outcome and predictor variables. Rather than manually calculating a complicated nested for loop index (I'm calling this "matindex" here), you can also just set the nrow of "outmat" as zero and repeatedly rbind the new row to "outmat" with `outmat <- rbind(outmat, newrow)`, though this runs a bit slower. Ultimately, apply is faster than for loops, and for loops run faster when you create matrices, etc. to be filled ahead of time (e.g., an empty a x b matrix rather than a 0 x b matrix you repeatedly stick rows on the bottom of). Notice the diversity of output you can create. Here we output a data frame summarizing our coefficients of interest, a forest plot of those coefficients, and a list of all linear model objects (which are lists storing all sorts of info related to the model, including coefficients, p-values, the data used for the model, etc.) in case we want to extract more information from them.

```{r}
library(ggplot2)

multilm <- function(preds,outs,Data,covars=NULL){
  lmlist<-list() #empty list to fill
  outmat<-as.data.frame(matrix(NA,length(preds)*length(outs),7)) #empty data frame to fill with the for loop
  for(i in 1:length(outs)){
    for(j in 1:length(preds)){ #nested for loop
      matindex<-(1+(j-1))+((i-1)*length(preds)) #manually calculating the index for the nested loop
      if(is.null(covars)){
        thisform<-formula(paste0(outs[i],"~",preds[j]))
      } else {
        thisform<-formula(paste0(outs[i],"~",preds[j],"+",paste(covars,collapse="+")))
      }
      mylm<-lm(thisform,Data)
      lmlist[[paste0(outs[i],"~",preds[j])]]<-mylm
      outmat[matindex,1:2]<-c(outs[i],preds[j])
      outmat[matindex,c(3:4,7)]<-c(mylm$coef[2], summary(mylm)$coef[2,2], summary(mylm)$coef[2,4])
      outmat[matindex,5:6]<-confint(mylm)[2,]
    }
  }
  names(outmat)<-c("Outcome","Predictor","Beta","SE","LCI","UCI","p-value")
  forestplot <- ggplot(data=outmat, aes(x=Predictor,y=Beta)) + theme_bw() +
    geom_point(size=2) + geom_errorbar(aes(ymin=LCI,ymax=UCI),width=0.25) + 
    geom_hline(yintercept=0) +
    facet_wrap(~Outcome)
  #the above is ggplot-related code, which is important to learn for plotting
  outlist<-list(Results=outmat,ForestPlot=forestplot,LMlist=lmlist)
}

mlm1<-multilm(names(iris)[4:5],names(iris)[1:2],iris,names(iris)[3])
mlm1$Results
mlm1$ForestPlot
summary(mlm1$LMlist$`Sepal.Width~Petal.Width`)
```
